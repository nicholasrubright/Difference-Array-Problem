# Difference Array Problem
Given an array of distinct integer values, count the number of pairs of integers that have difference k.

## Solution
To solve this problem, I used two nested for loops to search through each element of the array (Selection Sort) and then compared them by an if statement, if the selected elements produced a difference k, then increment the number of pairs by 1.

## Code
To actually view the code I used to write this, check the folder labeled difference_array and look for the .cpp file.
